# sodium
An wrapper for libsodium in golang

NOTE: This is a modified version from github.com/GoKillers/libsodium-go.

Because there're a lot of package reformat and interface changes, I'd like to launch a new project.

Thankfully, the orignial author permit reuse its code as long as the original LICENSE remains.

You can find the LICENSE.original and README.original.md stating the original license.

To compile with Cgo under windows, you need a correctly configured pkg-config.

Follow the instruction about installation at https://download.libsodium.org/doc/installation/index.html.

To compile with Cgo under ubuntu/debian, you need a libsodium-dev package installed.
