# sodium
An wrapper for libsodium in golang

NOTE: This is a modified version from github.com/GoKillers/libsodium-go.

Because there're a lot of package reformat and interface changes, I'd like to launch a new project.

Thankfully, the orignial author permit reuse its code as long as the original LICENSE remains.

You can find the LICENSE.original and README.original.md stating the original license.
